# Formatting instructions

The tables in our README.md file have the following columns:

| **#** | **Course Name** | **Type** | **Length** | **Topic** | **Source** | **Author** | **Release Date** | **Paid?** |

1. Please stick to this order and try to provide information corresponding to as many of the columns as you can.
2. If you're unsure about **topic**, please leave it blank.
3. Some websites give duration of individual clips but not a total time for the course, it would be much appreciated if you could add up the time manually using this handy [Time Calculator](http://www.grun1.com/utils/timeCalc.html).
4. For books, please provide total number of pages under the **length** column.
5. For GitHub Repos, the release date is usually the date of the latest commit to master
